  <h1>Los Angeles Lakers</h1>
  <p>Los angeles Lakers are one of my favorite team and they are the best teams all-time in all NBA, they have the most championships with the count of 17, they had the best players in that team like Kobe, Shaq, Magic Johnson, Kareem, Wilt chamberlain, Jerry West, Lebron James, etc. The Lakers are the team that had the more impact in the NBA then other teams, they went to the finals 32 times(17 wins and 15 lost)</p>
